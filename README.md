# Arduino-based-Fire-Extinguisher-Robot-Robotics-Project

The project was taken from this link - https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-fire-fighting-robot-code
Since this was one of my initial works related to arduino, I had to make use of available projects and re-implement them by myself for my learning and good understanding. As this isn't my work, I had also linked the work I had reffered.
